My [company][simpleenergy] hosted a company hack day on Thursday.  Our team put
together an app for tracking our bughouse games.  It was a really cool
opportunity to indulge my recent love of javascript.

I put together a frontend with [backbone][backbone] + [marionette][marionette]
+ [handlebars][handlebars].  I'd recently cut my teeth on a prototype for
a one-page-checkout in an ecommerce solution I've been working on.  I've done a
reasonable amount of front end in my career, and every time, it's been a
garbled mess of unmaintainable junk.

This time was different.

I've been working within the high castle walls of [Django][django] for the
majority of my career.  Each time, I would begin with a pre-rendered page,
returned by the server and try to slap some javascript onto the page and turn
it into an application.  It wasn't until this this past few weeks that I
realized that my previous pain and failures came out of my unwillingness to
shift enough of the programming and logic to the front end.

I'm currently only two apps in, but so far, I am loving it.  A whole world of
possibility has just opened up to me, and I'm excited to see where it leads.

Oh, and we won the "Best Overall" title for the hackday projects.  You can find
the sourcecode [here][bugsport].
