Up until about 2 months ago I had never heard of an [escape room][escape-room].
Rarely does the universe drop something so utterly perfectly matched to my
interests right into my lap, and much rejoicing has followed.

Since then I've had the pleasure of doing three.

#### Enigma

This was my first room, and thus first experience.  We failed to solve the
puzzle, but it was still an amazing experience.  The story was immersive.  The
puzzles and *props* in the room all felt like a contiguous thing.  Everything
was high quality, and overall I loved it.  I don't have a lot of escape room
experience, but I believe this room was very *classic* in design.

#### Denver Escape Rooms [Rescue]

Denver escape room was the second room we attempted and subsequently failed.  I
was not nearly as impressed by this room as I was with Enigma.  The room and
props felt *cheap* and broke some of the immersion.  The puzzle itself also
felt poorly designed.  The facilitator had to interject 3 times to get us
unstuck, each time breaking the immersion as well as highlighting that both our
group, and the puzzle were failing.  A good puzzle has a clear answer that
should be attainable without having to make too many *leaps* of faith.  It's ok
to require small guesses, but having to make giant guesses is the sign of
something poorly crafted (in my opinion).  One of the things we got stuck on
was a cheap lock ([one of these][lock-example].  Three of us had attempted the
correct combination with none of us getting the lock open.  It wasn't until the
facilitator told us we had the right combo that we got it open.

#### Puzzah!

Puzzah was the third room we attempted, and first success.  We actually
set the fastest record (as of December 28th).  Puzzah was awesome.  The guys
behind it are going things right.  The puzzle itself was well crafted.  The
room and story were immersive.


If you want to hit up an escape room in the Boulder/Denver area, you can't go
wrong with either Enigma or Puzzah.
