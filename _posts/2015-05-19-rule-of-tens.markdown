> *It takes roughly ten thousand hours of practice to achieve mastery in a field* - Malcome Gladwell

That quote comes from the book [**Outliers**][outliers] by Malcome Gladwell.  10,000
hours works out to doing something full time (40 hours per week) for 5 years.

`40 hours/week **x** 50 weeks/year *x* 5 years = 10,000 hours`

Note that this is the same as.

- part time for 10 years
- very dedicated hobby for 20 years (10 hours/week)

What is more interesting to me than actual mastery is the road that leads
to mastery.  What milemarkers might one encounter along the way.

## 10 Hours

A 10 hour investment is:

- Your second day at a full time job.
- Maybe your third day of a part time job.
- Then end of your first week at a hobby you do 5 days a week, 2 hours a day.
- Your 5th week doing something once a week for 2 hours a day.

For the things I've stuck with this long (Sewing, DJing and mixing music, Swing
dancing, Piano):

- I no longer felt utterly awkward doing it.
- I knew a few thing that I could practice.
- I was very bad at most of what I knew how to do.
- I had one or two things that I felt like I was doing well.
- I had a good handle on the vocabulary.

## 100 Hours

This is equal to:

- Your 3rd week at a full time job.
- Your 5th week at a part time job.
- A hobby you do 5 days a week ,2 hours per day, for 10 weeks (2 1/2 months)
- A hobby you do for 2 hours, once per week, for a full year.

For the things that I've stuck with this long (Woodworking, Cyr Wheel, American
Sign Language, Using AWS):

- I felt confident in my skillset.
- I knew there were still big things I didn't know.
- Learning new things was very regular.
- I could begin teaching others.

## 1,000 Hours

This is equal to:

- half a year of doing something full time.
- full year of doing something part time.
- A hobby you do 5 days a week ,2 hours per day, for 2 years.
- A hobby you do for 2 hours, once per week, for 10 years.

For the things I've stuck with this long (ultimate frisbey, aerial,
programming, climbing).

- I got to the point where I'd learned most all of the simple things
- I was down to focusingon things that took real work to get better at.
- I had been teaching people things in some capacity for a while.
- I was doing it in beyond a strictly personal fashion (playing in turnaments
  for ultimate, performing regularly with aerial, programming as my profession,
  competing in climbing competitions)


# Take-Aways

- 10,000 hours = Mastery
- 1,000 hours = Proficiency
- 100 hours = Familiarity
- 10 hours = ????

I like to think of 10 hours being the minimum amount of time you stick with
something before giving up, or choosing you don't like it.  Without this
investment, you typically don't know enough about it to know if you like it,
and not enough time to get over the initial learning curve.
