Sort of amazing how important context can be.

Last week on the bus home I was profoundly annoyed by a woman sitting two seats
behind me that was watching a video on her smartphone without headphones.  The
music coming from the video was profoundly distracting.  A few stops before
mine, she exited and the music continued.  Turns out there was a gentleman in
the back of the bus playing the guitar.  In the few minutes until my stop, I
went from being annoyed and distracted to enjoying some nice music on my ride
home.

Yesterday at work, I had a similar thing happen.  Someone was listening to
music on their computer without headphones.  I was on the verge of going to
find the culprit when I realized it was one of my co-workers playing his
ukulele.  Annoyance quickly transitioned to appreciation.

Context is really important.
