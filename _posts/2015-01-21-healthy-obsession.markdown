I recently read Paul Graham's post on [work][paul-graham-work].

> *What seems like work to other people that doesn't seem like work to you?* - Paul Graham

The *readers digest* version is that you should pay attention to the things
that you find fun that the world around you seems to dislike.  Within those
things may lie a career in which you will be excited to go to work each day.

I've considered myself blessed to have landed so unintentionally in world of
programming.  I've been somewhat obsessed with my computer since middle school
and here I am roughly 20 years later making a solid living doing something I
love.

It's that sort of obsession that I've been mulling over recently.  I know from
my past that I'm succeptable to types of addiction.  World of Warcraft consumed
a few years of my life that I'll never get back.  Later, in college, I found a
similar obession in proof solving.  Here in front of me was an endless stream
of stimulating problems for me to get lost in.  The best part of it was
that I was encouraged to indulge myself, as opposed my WoW days when I had to
hide it from the disapproving eyes of girlfriends/friends/family.

Since then, I've moved onto the problems of a software developer.  I'm lucky to
have found this outlet for myself.  Without it my life could have gone a very
different direction.  As with anything that can be labeled an obsession, it
comes with it's downsides.  The more engaged I am with the problem I'm solving
the harder I find it to be engaged in the other parts of my life.  It's hard to
be *present* with my wife or son when I've spent most of the day deep in the
problem space.  I find my mind drifting back into the problem when I should be
there with them.

I don't idle well either.  I get anxious when I'm between problems.  I imagnine
it's similar to watching an addict itching for their fix.

The more engaged I am in something, the worse I sleep.  I lay awake stuck on
the thing I'm trying to solve, and once I finally drift off, it's only into restless sleep
where my subconcious picks up where my concious mind left off.  Ironically,
using my subconscious like this is one of the tools that has helped me solve
some of the hardest problems.

The rush I get when that fully formed solution floods into my mind makes it all
worth it.  I expect this will always be something I struggle to maintain a healthy balance.
Some day I may leave software behind.  Chances are it will be for some new
obsession, and I hope its a healthy one.
