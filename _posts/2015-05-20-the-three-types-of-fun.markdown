This has been a personal guideline that I *Think* I stole from my brother.  We
call it *The Three Types of Fun*, and it goes something like this.

# Type 1 Fun

Things that can be thought of as **type 1 fun** are:

- good food
- sex
- most drugs.

For most people, these things are easy to enjoy.  These are easy,
reliable, go-tos.

# Type 2 Fun


**Type 2 Fun** on the other hand is often not fun while you are doing them, but
now that it's been a few days, weeks, or even years, you remember it being fun.

- Running a marathon
- Getting really lost.
- Anything that could be called *"grueling"*

# Type 3 Fun

This is stuff that you thought was going to be type 1 or 2 fun, but turned out
to not be fun at all.  These are all things that seemed like they were going to
be enjoyable at the time, and now, looking back on them, did not find them
enjoyable at all.

- Taking a lot of acid.
- Getting **really** drunk.
- The Fucking Unicorn Art Car.


An interesting thing about **type 3 fun** is that it can be thought of as
things that have not become **type 2 fun**.


# Closing Thoughts

I like to think life is at least in part about trying to move as many things as
possible to a lower category.  It seems like a good indicator that you are
living your life open to change, and trying to find the good in things.  Both
of those are things I want to be able to say about myself when I'm old and
fading.
